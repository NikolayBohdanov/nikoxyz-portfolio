title: 'How We Built TwitterScore: AI-Powered Crypto Research'

summary: 'An inside look at our methodology for combining social signals, on-chain data, and AI to evaluate crypto projects before they hit the mainstream.'

When we started TwitterScore in 2024, the crypto research landscape was broken. Retail investors were drowning in noise—Discord alerts, Twitter shills, and paid influencer posts. Meanwhile, institutional-grade tools cost thousands per month and required data science teams to extract value.

We asked a simple question: **What if we could surface high-quality crypto projects earlier by analyzing social graphs with AI?**

## The Core Insight

Traditional crypto research focuses on two inputs: tokenomics and on-chain metrics. Both are valuable but lagging indicators. By the time a project shows strong fundamentals on-chain, smart money has already positioned.

We identified a third signal that's earlier and often more predictive: **social velocity**—the rate at which quality crypto-native accounts discover and engage with new projects.

## Our Methodology

### 1. Data Collection

We index millions of tweets daily, but not all data is equal. We weight accounts by:

- **Historical alpha generation** (did they call previous winners?)
- **Network centrality** (are they connected to other quality voices?)
- **Engagement quality** (bots and coordinated pumps are filtered out)

### 2. Signal Extraction

Raw mention counts are meaningless. A project mentioned by 1,000 bot accounts is noise. One mentioned by 50 verified builders is signal.

We use a custom fine-tuned language model to:

- Extract project mentions from unstructured text
- Classify sentiment and intent (shill vs. genuine analysis vs. FUD)
- Identify the "quality tier" of the conversation

### 3. Composite Scoring

The final TwitterScore aggregates social signals with on-chain verification:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Social Velocity | 40% | Weighted mention growth over time |
| Account Quality | 35% | Average credibility of discussing accounts |
| On-Chain Growth | 25% | Holder growth, smart money inflows |

## Results

Over 18 months, projects scoring >85 on TwitterScore before $10M market cap showed:

- **3.2x higher** likelihood of reaching $100M+ MC
- **47% lower** incidence of rug pulls vs. random sample
- **12-day earlier** detection on average vs. CoinGecko trending

## The Future

We're expanding beyond Twitter to include Farcaster, Lens, and Telegram quality channels. The goal remains the same: **surface signal from noise, earlier than anyone else.**
