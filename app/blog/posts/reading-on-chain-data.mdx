On-chain analysis is the closest thing crypto has to fundamental analysis. While stocks have earnings reports and balance sheets, crypto projects have transparent, immutable ledgers that reveal real usage and capital flows.

This guide covers the essential metrics I check before any significant investment.

## 1. Holder Distribution

**What it tells you:** Centralization risk and potential sell pressure

A project with 90% of tokens held by the top 10 wallets is a ticking time bomb. I use this simple heuristic:

**Red flags:**
- Single wallet holding >10% of supply
- Declining unique holders during price pumps
- Team wallets moving tokens to exchanges

**Green flags:**
- Steady, organic holder growth
- Top wallets decreasing % over time (distribution)
- Long-term holders accumulating (low velocity)

## 2. Exchange Flows

**What it tells you:** Near-term sell/buy pressure

- Large outflows from exchanges = accumulation
- Large inflows = prepare for volatility

**Key insight:** Track exchange wallets for unusual activity before major moves.

## 3. Smart Money Tracking

**What it tells you:** What sophisticated players are doing

I track a curated list of wallets with proven track records:

| Wallet Type | Signal Quality | Look For |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| VC vesting unlocks | High | Early selling vs. holding |
| Whale accumulators | Medium | Consistent buying patterns |
| Founders/Team | Very High | Any unusual movements |

**Pro tip:** Set up Dune dashboards or Nansen alerts for your watchlist. Catching a smart money accumulation trend early is worth the subscription cost.

## 4. Network Activity Metrics

**What it tells you:** Real usage vs. speculation

For DeFi protocols, I track:

- **TVL (Total Value Locked)**: Is the product actually being used?
- **Active addresses**: Unique users, not just transaction count
- **Transaction volume**: Revenue proxy for fee-generating protocols
- **Revenue/protocol fees**: The ultimate fundamental metric

## 5. Funding Rates and Open Interest

**What it tells you:** Market sentiment and leverage

High funding rates + rising open interest = overheated market, potential for long squeeze.

Negative funding rates during consolidation = bearish sentiment, potential bottom.

## Putting It All Together

Before I invest, I score projects across these dimensions:

| Metric | Weight | Score (1-10) |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Holder distribution | 20% | ? |
| Exchange flows (7d) | 15% | ? |
| Smart money alignment | 25% | ? |
| Network growth | 25% | ? |
| Funding/sentiment | 15% | ? |

A composite score > 7.5 with positive momentum across multiple metrics = high conviction setup.

## Tools of the Trade

- **Dune Analytics**: Custom dashboards, free tier is generous
- **Nansen**: Smart money labels, institutional grade
- **DeFiLlama**: Protocol metrics, TVL, revenue
- **Arkham**: Wallet labeling and tracking
- **Glassnode**: Bitcoin/Ethereum on-chain data
