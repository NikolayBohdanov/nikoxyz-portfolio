Due diligence in DeFi used to be a full-time job. A single project required:

- Reading 50+ pages of documentation
- Manually reviewing smart contract code
- Monitoring Discord and Twitter for weeks
- Tracking wallet movements across chains

Today, AI agents can compress this into minutes. Here's how I use LLMs in my research workflow.

## The Research Stack

### 1. Automated Document Analysis

Whitepapers are marketing documents. The real information lives in GitHub repos, governance forums, and obscure Medium posts.

I feed project documentation into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that:

- Extracts tokenomics parameters
- Identifies vesting schedules and unlock dates
- Flags discrepancies between marketing claims and technical reality

### 2. Smart Contract Auditing

AI won't replace human auditors, but it's an incredible first-pass filter. I use specialized models to:

- Detect common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, unchecked transfers)
- Compare implementations against known secure patterns
- Identify centralization risks (owner privileges, upgradeability)

Example red flag AI catches instantly:
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw() external onlyOwner {
    payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    // AI flags: No timelock, unlimited access to funds
}
```

### 3. Sentiment Synthesis

Community sentiment analysis used to mean reading thousands of Discord messages. Now, LLMs can:

- Summarize key concerns from governance discussions
- Detect coordinated FUD campaigns vs. genuine criticism
- Track sentiment shifts around major announcements

## Real-World Example

Last month, I analyzed a new L2 project in under 20 minutes:

| Task | Traditional Time | With AI | Time Saved |
|------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Documentation review | 2 hours | 5 minutes | 95% |
| Code vulnerability scan | 4 hours | 10 minutes | 96% |
| Community sentiment | 3 hours | 5 minutes | 97% |
| **Total** | **9 hours** | **20 minutes** | **96%** |

The AI flagged a concerning centralization vector the whitepaper glossed over. I passed on the investment—two weeks later, the team abused that exact privilege.

## Limitations and Risks

AI is powerful but dangerous if trusted blindly:

- **Hallucinations**: Models can confidently cite non-existent vulnerabilities
- **Training cutoff**: New attack vectors may not be in the model's knowledge
- **Context gaps**: AI misses the "vibe" of a community that humans sense

**Rule of thumb**: Use AI to accelerate research, not replace judgment. Always verify critical claims.

## The Future

We're building toward fully autonomous research agents that:

- Continuously monitor project health
- Alert on anomalous on-chain activity
- Generate real-time risk scores

The human role shifts from data gathering to high-level strategy and validation.
